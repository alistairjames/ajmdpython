# ajmdpython
### A repository for example Python code.

CandidatesPython is an application written for work at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).  

The code is not of particular use to anyone else, but it illustrates the usefulness of Python for handling information collecting from remote servers and local files, for, sifting and merging the returned data and outputting the result.  

Since all the information collected by the code is from public sources, the code will run outside the EBI network.  

The code was written on Linux, but also tested to work on Windows 10.  

A full description of what the code does, is inside the CandidatesPython folder
